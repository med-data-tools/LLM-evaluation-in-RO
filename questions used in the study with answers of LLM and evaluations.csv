Based on the pathogenesis of radiation-induced secondary cancers is it better to normofractionate (= single doses of around 2 Gy) or moderately hypofractionate (= single doses of around 3 Gy or higher) a patient with a Li-Fraumeni syndrome (p53 mutation) if radiotherapy has been deemed necessary?;3,67;Other;It is better to normofractionate a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (p53 mutation) if radiotherapy has been deemed necessary. This is because normofractionation (single doses of around 2 Gy) is associated with a lower risk of radiation-induced secondary cancers compared to moderately hypofractionation (single doses of around 3 Gy or higher).;4;2
I have a patient with acute kidney failure where both prerenal and intrarenal aetiology are possible. How was it again possible to discern these two aetiologies based on the laboratory values (including sodium and kreatinin)?;3,33;Other;In prerenal acute kidney failure, the urinary sodium concentration is typically less than 20 mmol/L, while in intrinsic acute kidney failure, it is usually greater than 40 mmol/L. This difference can help distinguish between the two etiologies.;4;2
What is the life expectancy (median overall survival) for a patient that has refused the 5th line of chemotherapy after multifocal progression of his aggressive lymphoma (a PTLD) that was diagnosed 4 years ago and currently in an ECOG performance status of 1-2?;4,67;Other;The median overall survival for a patient with aggressive lymphoma who has refused further chemotherapy after multifocal progression is difficult to predict without specific details on the type and stage of lymphoma. However, generally, the prognosis for patients with aggressive lymphomas that have progressed after multiple lines of treatment is poor. It is important to consider individual patient factors, such as age, overall health, and response to previous treatments, in estimating life expectancy. It would be best to discuss this case with the patient's oncologist for a more accurate prediction.;4;4
After how many days after starting Pregabalin for neuropathic pain should increase of dose be considered if pain response is insufficient?;3,00;Other;Dose escalation of Pregabalin for neuropathic pain should be considered after 3 days if the pain response is insufficient.;4;4
In a patient with suspected tumorous mass in the area of C6 vertebra, a biopsy diagnosed a grade 3 chondrosarcoma. Subsequently, a two-stage resection was performed. However, after the second operation, a residual tumor remained in the area of the paravertebral muscles. The tumor board decided on adjuvant radiotherapy. What target dose should be aimed for? Should different doses be prescribed for different target volumes? Which organ-at-risk is the most relevant, and what constraint can be applied here?;3,33;Other;The target dose for adjuvant radiotherapy in this case should be 60-66 Gy. Different doses can be prescribed for different target volumes, with a higher dose for the gross tumor volume (GTV) and a lower dose for the clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV). The most relevant organ-at-risk in this case is the spinal cord, and a constraint of 45-50 Gy can be applied to it.;3;1
